Table: Pairwise Wilcoxon rank-sum test comparing CLR-transformed genus-level abundances between diet groups (HOA vs. control) within each time point. P-values were adjusted for multiple comparisons using the Benjamini–Hochberg (BH) method. Only genus-timepoint combinations with available data are included.,,,,,,
